# A brief history on Free and Open Source Software

The principle of Free Open Source Software, as we now know it, started with Richard Stallman’s development of the concept of “free software” in the early 1980s. To further his vision, not to mention some pretty good software, Richard went on to build the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation. It took some more decades, but it became apparent to most people at the beginning of the 2000s that the vision of free software was consolidating the share of minds around the world.
